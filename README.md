# Project 3
## DNA Translation

The DNA Translation program is a very basic program that was meant to assist in biology in an automated process.

## Objective

Project 3 is a very basic program that reads DNA strings and converts them into a string of protein strands. It uses the basics of DNA transcription from Biology in order to do this. This project was a side project for my Biology 101 class at SWIC. The professor wanted a small program in order to help grade his quizzes and tests that was reliable.

## Running the Program

In this directory, there is 1 file that can be executed. You can run the source code (.java) through the command line.

### Running the .java files through command line

In a command line, after navigating to the correct directory, type the following commands:  
javac DNATrans.java  
java DNATrans

## Using the Program

To use the program, you must type in a string of characters in the following formats:

5' ATCGATGCATGCATGCTAGCTAGCTGACTGCA 3' 

or

3' ATGCTAGCTAGCTGACTGATCGATGCATGCAG 5' 

All nucleotides must be in the format of A, T, C, or G 

The difference between these is the way that the DNA is sequenced. This needs to be specified, or else the correct DNA sequence cannot be determined.
